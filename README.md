# Celestial-Bodies-Database
A relational database created using PostgreSQL through a virtual machine on CodeAlly. This project was a part of the Relational Database curriculum on freeCodeCamp.

It is worth noting that all and any scientific information about Celestial Bodies is mostly false and made up for the purpose of filling in the gaps within the database.

However, the structure of the relational database is such that verifiable information can be replaced easily with the false information. This was done on purpose as the goal of this project was to learn PostgreSQL and how relational databases work.
